## What the Company Does

Texas Best Sprinklers solves three core problems for property owners in the DFW area:

**Irrigation** — The company designs, installs, repairs, and maintains sprinkler systems. This includes diagnosing and fixing broken heads, leaking valves, damaged pipes, wiring faults, low pressure, and controller malfunctions. New installations are custom-designed based on the property's sun exposure, slope, soil type, and plant material, using components from Rain Bird, Hunter, and Toro. The company installs Wi-Fi-enabled smart controllers that adjust watering schedules based on local weather data, soil moisture sensors, and flow meters. Smart upgrades can reduce water usage by up to 50%. Most repairs are completed in a single visit.

**Drainage** — North Texas clay soil holds water and expands/contracts seasonally, causing standing water, erosion, foundation stress, and mosquito problems. The company designs and installs French drains, channel drains, surface drains, catch basins, sump pumps, downspout extensions, and performs grading improvements. Each drainage solution is custom-designed based on site assessment of soil conditions, slope, water sources, and gutter discharge patterns.

**Outdoor Lighting** — The company installs and repairs low-voltage LED landscape lighting including path lights, spotlights, accent lighting, uplighting, and architectural lighting. Systems can be smart-enabled with timers, photocells, and app-controlled transformers. The company also retrofits existing halogen systems to LED.

## How the Service Process Works

1. Customer contacts the company by phone or through the website contact form.
2. A free on-site estimate is scheduled, typically within 24–48 business hours.
3. A licensed technician performs a thorough property assessment, discussing needs, water usage goals, and budget.
4. A custom plan is designed specific to the landscape's layout, soil type, and plant requirements.
5. Professional installation or repair is performed with minimal disruption, using Schedule 40 PVC manifolds, swing joints, brass backflow assemblies, and waterproof splices.
6. The system is calibrated and the customer receives a walkthrough on controller setup, seasonal changes, and basic maintenance.

## Regional Expertise

The company operates in the North Texas climate zone, which features hot summers (100°F+), mild winters with occasional hard freezes, and variable rainfall. The predominant soil type is heavy clay, which requires specialized irrigation design due to slow water absorption and seasonal expansion/contraction cycles. The company's systems are designed to account for these conditions, incorporating cycle-and-soak programming, pressure-regulated heads, deep root watering, and freeze-guard protection.

The company is knowledgeable about local watering restrictions across all municipalities it serves, including twice-weekly watering schedules, odd/even address rotation systems, and drought-stage guidelines. All installations comply with local city codes and water conservation regulations.
