Introduction
The Places API (New) includes the following APIs:

Place Details (New)
Place Photos (New)
Nearby Search (New)
Text Search (New)
Autocomplete (New)
This document contains an overview of these new APIs.

Place Details (New)
A place ID uniquely identifies a place in the Google Places database and on Google Maps. With a place ID, you can request details about a particular establishment or point of interest by initiating a Place Details (New) request. A Place Details (New) request returns comprehensive information about the indicated place such as its complete address, phone number, user rating, and reviews.

Note: You can get the same details about a place from Place Details (New) that you can also get from Text Search (New) or Nearby Search (New). However, if you already have the place ID of a location, calling Place Details (New) is less expensive than calling one of the search APIs.
There are many ways to obtain a place ID. You can use:

Text Search (New)
Nearby Search (New)
Geocoding API
Routes API
Address Validation API
Autocomplete (New)
Place Photos (New)
Place Photos (New) lets you add high quality photographic content to your application by giving you access to the millions of photos stored in the Google Places database. Using the Place Photos (New) API, you can access the photos and resize the image to the optimal size for your application.

All requests to the Place Photos (New) API must include a photo resource name, which uniquely identifies the photo to return. You can obtain the photo resource name by using:

Place Details (New)
Text Search (New)
Nearby Search (New)
To include the photo resource name in the response from a Place Details (New), Text Search (New), or Nearby Search (New) request, make sure that you include the photos field in the field mask of the request.

Text Search (New) and Nearby Search (New)
The Places API includes two search APIs:

Text Search (New)

Lets you specify a text string on which to search for a place. For example: "Spicy Vegetarian Food in Sydney, Australia" or "Fine seafood dining near Palo Alto, CA".

You can refine the search by specifying details such as price levels, current opening status, ratings, or specific place types. You can also specify to bias the results to a specific location, or restrict the search to a specific location.

Nearby Search (New)

Lets you specify a region to search along with a list of place types. Specify the region as a circle defined by the latitude and longitude coordinates of the center point and radius in meters.

Specify one or more place types that define the characteristics of the place. For example, specify "pizza_restaurant" and "shopping_mall" to search for a pizza restaurant located in a shopping mall in the specified region.

The main difference between the two searches is that Text Search (New) lets you specify an arbitrary search string while Nearby Search (New) requires a specific area in which to search.

Autocomplete (New) and session tokens
Autocomplete (New) is a web service that returns place predictions and query predictions in response to an HTTP request. In the request, specify a text search string and geographic bounds that controls the search area.

Session tokens are user-generated strings that track Autocomplete (New) calls as sessions. Autocomplete (New) uses session tokens to group the query and selection phases of a user autocomplete search into a discrete session for billing purposes.

New fields, attributes, and accessibility options
The Places API (New) includes new fields, attributes, and accessibility options to provide users with more information about a place. These aspects are described in the following sections.

Fields
The Places API (New) includes several new fields:

Field	Description
regularSecondaryOpeningHours	Describes particular times for certain operations. Secondary opening hours are different from a business's main hours. For example, a restaurant can specify drive through hours or delivery hours as its secondary hours.
paymentOptions	Payment options the place accepts. A place can accept more than one payment option. If payment option data is not available, the payment option field will be unset. Options include the following:
Credit card
Debit card
Cash only
NFC payment
parkingOptions	Parking options provided by the place. Options include the following:
Free parking lots
Paid parking lots
Free street parking
Valet parking
Free garage parking
Paid garage parking
subDestinations	Unique places that are related to a particular place. For example, airport terminals are considered sub-destinations of an airport.
fuelOptions	The most recent information about fuel options available at a gas station. This information is updated regularly. Options include the following:
Diesel
Regular unleaded
Midgrade
Premium
SP91
SP91 E10
SP92
SP95 E10
SP98
SP99
SP100
LPG
E80
E85
Methane
Biodiesel
Truck diesel
evChargeOptions	Number of electric vehicle (EV) chargers at this station. While some EV chargers have multiple connectors, each charger can only charge one vehicle at a time; as a result, this field reflects the number of available EV chargers at a given time.
shortFormattedAddress	A short, human-readable address for a place.
primaryType	The primary type of the given result. For example, a place may be classified as a cafe or an airport. A place can only have a single primary type. For the complete list of possible values, see Supported types.
primaryTypeDisplayName	The display name of the primary type, localized to the request language if applicable. For the complete list of possible values, see Supported types.
Attributes
The Places API (New) includes several new attributes:

Attribute	Description
outdoorSeating	Place provides outdoor seating.
liveMusic	Place provides live music.
menuForChildren	Place has a children's menu.
servesCocktails	Place serves cocktails.
servesDessert	Place serves dessert.
servesCoffee	Place serves coffee.
goodForChildren	Place is good for children.
allowsDogs	Place allows dogs.
restroom	Place has a restroom.
goodForGroups	Place accommodates groups.
goodForWatchingSports	Place is suitable for watching sports.
Accessibility options
The Places API (New) includes the following accessibility option fields:

Field	Description
wheelchairAccessibleParking	Place offers wheelchair-accessible parking.
wheelchairAccessibleEntrance	Place has a wheelchair-accessible entrance.
wheelchairAccessibleRestroom	Place has a wheelchair-accessible restroom.
wheelchairAccessibleSeating	Place has wheelchair-accessible seating.
AI-powered summaries
Places API (New) AI-powered summaries use Gemini model capabilities to return summaries about places and areas that can help users decide where to go.

AI-powered summaries synthesize data from a variety of inputs to help users make more informed decisions about a place. For example, if you are considering trying a new restaurant, an AI-powered summary can surface common menu highlights, give you an idea of the vibe, or pull together themes from user reviews. If you are visiting a new city, an AI-powered summary can provide an overview of nearby attractions and amenities.

Note: All AI-powered summaries displayed in your app must be accompanied by the appropriate attribution in accordance with Google's policies and standards. For more information, see Policies for Places API.
AI-powered features added to the Places API (New)
AI-powered summaries are supported by Place Details (New), Text Search (New), and Nearby Search (New). The following AI-powered summaries are available in Places API (New) responses:

Place summaries, which are short overview summaries related to a specific place.
Review summaries, which are digestible summaries of what reviewers have said about a place.
Area summaries, which provide overviews of nearby and popular places in the surrounding area. These include neighborhood summaries and EV charging station summaries.
Google frequently regenerates these summaries to ensure that they are fresh based on the latest available information. When you make a Places API (New) request, you will display the freshest data in your app.

Try the AI-powered summaries demoopen_in_new

Fetch fields
If you have an existing Place object or place ID, use the Place.fetchFields() method to get details about that place. Provide a comma-separated list of place data fields to return; specify field names in camel case. Use the returned Place object to get data for the requested fields.

The following example uses a place ID to create a new Place, calls Place.fetchFields() requesting the displayName and formattedAddress fields, adds a marker to the map, and logs some data to the console.


TypeScript
JavaScript

async function getPlaceDetails() {
    const { Place } =  await google.maps.importLibrary("places") as google.maps.PlacesLibrary;
    const { AdvancedMarkerElement } = await google.maps.importLibrary("marker") as google.maps.MarkerLibrary;
    // Use place ID to create a new Place instance.
    const place = new Place({
        id: 'ChIJyYB_SZVU2YARR-I1Jjf08F0', // San Diego Zoo
    });

    // Call fetchFields, passing the desired data fields.
    await place.fetchFields({ fields: ['displayName', 'formattedAddress', 'location', 'googleMapsURI'] });

    // Add an Advanced Marker
    const marker = new AdvancedMarkerElement({
        map: innerMap,
        position: place.location,
        title: place.displayName,
    });

    // Assemble the info window content.
    const content = document.createElement('div');
    const address = document.createElement('div');
    const placeId = document.createElement('div');
    address.textContent = place.formattedAddress || '';
    placeId.textContent = place.id;
    content.append(placeId, address);

    if (place.googleMapsURI) {
        const link = document.createElement('a');
        link.href = place.googleMapsURI;
        link.target = '_blank';
        link.textContent = 'View Details on Google Maps';
        content.appendChild(link);
    }

    // Display an info window.
    infoWindow.setHeaderContent(place.displayName);
    infoWindow.setContent(content);
    infoWindow.open({
        anchor: marker,
    });
}
Note: Read the guide on using TypeScript and Google Maps.
Note that Map and Place have been declared prior to this function:
const { Map } = await google.maps.importLibrary("maps");
const { Place } = await google.maps.importLibrary("places");

AI-generated Key Takeaways
European Economic Area (EEA) developers
Place reviews lets you access millions of high-quality reviews and ratings from the Places database, and display them on your web pages.


See the complete example source code
Get reviews for a place
To get review data for a place, include the reviews field in your fetchFields() request parameters. The resulting Place instance contains an array of Review objects, from which you may access the needed review information.

The following example shows making a Place Details request for reviews.


// Use a place ID to create a new Place instance.
const place = new Place({
  id: "ChIJpyiwa4Zw44kRBQSGWKv4wgA", // Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Boston, MA
});

// Call fetchFields, passing 'reviews' and other needed fields.
await place.fetchFields({
  fields: ["displayName", "formattedAddress", "location", "reviews"],
});
// If there are any reviews display the first one.
if (place.reviews && place.reviews.length > 0) {
  // Get info for the first review.
  let reviewRating = place.reviews[0].rating;
  let reviewText = place.reviews[0].text;
  let authorName = place.reviews[0].authorAttribution.displayName;
  let authorUri = place.reviews[0].authorAttribution.uri;

  // Format the review using HTML.
  contentString = `
          <div id="title"><b>${place.displayName}</b></div>
          <div id="address">${place.formattedAddress}</div>
          <a href="${authorUri}" target="_blank">Author: ${authorName}</a>
          <div id="rating">Rating: ${reviewRating} stars</div>
          <div id="rating"><p>Review: ${reviewText}</p></div>`;
} else {
  contentString = "No reviews were found for " + place.displayName + ".";
}

// Create an infowindow to display the review.
infoWindow = new InfoWindow({
  content: contentString,
  ariaLabel: place.displayName,
});
The Review instance contains the following:

An AuthorAttribution
The rating given by the user.
The publishTime (Date), and relativePublishTimeDescription (review time relative to the current time for example "a month ago").
The review text.
The textLanguageCode indicating the language in which the review is written.
To get the overall rating for the place, use the Place.rating property (you must request the rating field in your fetchFields() request parameters).

Author attributions
When you display a review, you must also display the author attributions for the review. Use the AuthorAttribution class to return attributions. An attribution includes the author's name (displayName), a URI for their Google Maps profile (uri), and a URI for the author's photo (photoURI). The following snippet shows returning the displayName, uri, and photoURI for an attribution.

  let authorName = place.reviews[0].authorAttribution!.displayName;
  let authorUri = place.reviews[0].authorAttribution!.uri;
  let authorPhoto = place.reviews[0].authorAttribution!.photoURI;
