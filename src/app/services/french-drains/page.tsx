            What Is a French Drain?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed text-lg">
            A French drain is a subsurface drainage system that collects and redirects excess groundwater away from problem areas. It consists of a trench filled with gravel or rock that contains a perforated pipe. The system works by collecting water through the gravel and pipe perforations, then carrying it away from your home or problem areas to a suitable discharge point, preventing water damage and soil erosion.

            Expert Installation Process
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed text-lg">
            Our French drain installation begins with a thorough assessment of your property's water flow patterns and soil conditions. We then create a custom design that addresses your specific drainage issues. Our installation team excavates a properly sloped trench, installs geotextile fabric, lays high-quality perforated pipe, surrounds it with clean drainage gravel, and carefully restores your landscape for a seamless finish.
