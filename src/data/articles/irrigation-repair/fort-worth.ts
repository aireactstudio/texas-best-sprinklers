  introduction: "Fort Worth's unique mix of seasonal extremes and varied soil conditions puts constant stress on irrigation systems, leading to frequent repair needs. From the alternating clay and limestone substrates of western neighborhoods to the sandy loams of eastern areas, local sprinkler systems face challenges from soil shifting, mineral-heavy water, and temperature fluctuations. When your system shows signs of trouble—whether through pressure issues, uneven coverage, or unexpected increases in water bills—professional diagnostics and repair can quickly restore optimal function while preventing water waste.",
  
  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Clogged Spray Heads & Nozzles',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Fort Worth's municipal water contains minerals that accumulate in spray heads and nozzles over time, particularly in older neighborhoods with aging infrastructure. These deposits restrict water flow, creating uneven spray patterns and dry spots. Our technicians use specialized cleaning solutions to dissolve buildup without damaging components, restoring proper spray patterns and coverage."
    },
    {
      title: 'Pressure Regulation Problems',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Areas like Ridglea and Wedgwood frequently experience municipal pressure fluctuations that damage irrigation components. Too much pressure causes misting and rapid wear of internal valve parts, while insufficient pressure results in inadequate coverage. We install appropriate pressure regulators and zone-specific pressure compensating heads to maintain optimal performance regardless of municipal supply variations."
    },
    {
      title: 'Seasonal Ground Shifting',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Fort Worth's expansive clay soils expand during rainy periods and contract during drought, putting stress on rigid PVC pipes and fittings. This seasonal movement often causes underground leaks at connection points. Our repair approach uses flexible couplings at strategic junction points that accommodate ground movement without compromising system integrity."
    },
    {
      title: 'Controller Programming Issues',
      icon: 'check',
      content: "Many Fort Worth systems suffer from improper programming that doesn't account for local watering restrictions or seasonal needs. We recalibrate controllers to optimize watering while respecting Fort Worth's twice-weekly watering schedule, incorporating seasonal adjustments and integrating with weather sensors to prevent watering during rain events."
    },
    {
      title: 'Valve Malfunctions',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Fort Worth's hard water gradually degrades valve diaphragms and solenoids, causing valves to stick open (resulting in flooded areas) or fail to open (creating dry zones). We troubleshoot electrical and mechanical valve issues, replacing worn components with heavy-duty alternatives specifically designed for Fort Worth's water quality."
    }

  diagnosticProcess: [
    {
      title: 'System Inspection',
      content: "We begin with a comprehensive evaluation of your entire irrigation system, checking each zone for proper operation, inspecting heads for damage or misalignment, and testing valve function to identify both obvious and hidden issues."
    },
    {
      title: 'Pressure Testing',
      content: "Using calibrated gauges, we measure static and dynamic water pressure throughout your system to identify pressure loss points, excessive pressure zones, or flow restrictions that might indicate leaks or blockages."
    },
    {
      title: 'Controller Analysis',
      content: "We examine your controller programming, wiring connections, and sensor integration to ensure everything is functioning correctly and optimized for Fort Worth's climate conditions and watering regulations."
    },
    {
      title: 'Repair Implementation',
      content: "Based on our findings, we perform necessary repairs—replacing damaged components, clearing blockages, fixing leaks, and adjusting heads—using high-quality parts specifically selected for durability in Fort Worth conditions."
    },
    {
      title: 'System Calibration',
      content: "After repairs are complete, we fine-tune each zone, adjusting head spray patterns, optimizing run times, and programming your controller for maximum efficiency while ensuring full coverage of your landscape."

    {
      title: 'Spring System Audit',
      content: "Before Fort Worth's hot season begins, schedule a comprehensive inspection to test each zone, clean filters, check valve operation, and verify controller programming for seasonal appropriateness."
    },
    {
      title: 'Monthly Visual Inspection',
      content: "Regularly observe your system during operation, looking for heads that aren't popping up fully, uneven spray patterns, excessively wet areas (potential leaks), or dry spots that may indicate developing problems."
    },
    {
      title: 'Controller Updates',
      content: "Adjust your watering schedule quarterly to account for Fort Worth's seasonal shifts, particularly reducing frequency during winter months and adapting to the city's watering restrictions during summer conservation periods."
