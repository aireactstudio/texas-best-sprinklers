  introduction: "Westlake's premium residential properties with extensive landscaping require irrigation systems that perform flawlessly year-round. From the exclusive neighborhoods of Vaquero to the elegant estates throughout the area, local sprinkler systems face challenges from mineral-rich water, seasonal temperature fluctuations, and the high expectations of property owners. When your system shows signs of trouble—whether through pressure issues, uneven coverage, or unexpected increases in water bills—professional diagnostics and repair can quickly restore optimal function while preserving your landscape investment and preventing water waste.",
  
  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Clogged Spray Heads & Nozzles',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Westlake's water supply contains minerals that accumulate in spray heads and nozzles over time, particularly affecting the performance of precision irrigation components. These deposits restrict water flow, creating uneven spray patterns and dry spots. Our technicians use specialized cleaning solutions to dissolve buildup without damaging components, restoring proper spray patterns and coverage to maintain your property's pristine appearance."
    },
    {
      title: 'Pressure Regulation Problems',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Westlake properties often feature extensive irrigation zones that require precise pressure management. Too much pressure causes misting and rapid wear of internal valve parts, while insufficient pressure results in inadequate coverage. We install appropriate pressure regulators and zone-specific pressure compensating heads to maintain optimal performance throughout your entire system."
    },
    {
      title: 'Smart Controller Malfunctions',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Many Westlake properties utilize sophisticated smart controllers that can develop programming issues or connectivity problems. Our technicians are certified in troubleshooting and repairing advanced irrigation technology, ensuring your smart system functions properly with weather sensors, flow monitoring, and mobile connectivity."

    {
      title: 'Seasonal Programming Adjustments',
      icon: 'check',
      content: "Many Westlake systems suffer from improper programming that doesn't account for local watering restrictions or seasonal needs. We recalibrate controllers to optimize watering while respecting local watering schedules, incorporating seasonal adjustments and integrating with weather sensors to prevent watering during rain events."
    },
    {
      title: 'Valve Malfunctions',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Westlake's hard water gradually degrades valve diaphragms and solenoids, causing valves to stick open (resulting in flooded areas) or fail to open (creating dry zones). We troubleshoot electrical and mechanical valve issues, replacing worn components with premium alternatives specifically designed for longevity and reliability."

    },
    {
      title: 'Pressure Testing',
      content: "Using calibrated gauges, we measure static and dynamic water pressure throughout your system to identify pressure loss points, excessive pressure zones, or flow restrictions that might indicate leaks or blockages."
    },
    {
      title: 'Controller Analysis',
      content: "We examine your controller programming, wiring connections, and sensor integration to ensure everything is functioning correctly and optimized for Westlake's climate conditions and watering regulations."
