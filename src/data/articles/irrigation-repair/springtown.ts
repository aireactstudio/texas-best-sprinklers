  introduction: "Springtown's diverse properties—from established neighborhoods to rural acreages—create unique challenges for irrigation systems. Local sprinkler systems face challenges from varying water quality, pressure fluctuations, and the region's clay soil conditions. When your system shows signs of trouble—whether through pressure issues, uneven coverage, or unexpected increases in water bills—professional diagnostics and repair can quickly restore optimal function while preserving your landscape investment and preventing water waste.",
  
  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Mineral Buildup & Clogging',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Springtown's water supply, particularly from wells, often contains minerals that accumulate in spray heads, nozzles, and valves over time. These deposits restrict water flow, creating uneven spray patterns and dry spots. Our technicians use specialized cleaning solutions to dissolve buildup without damaging components, restoring proper spray patterns and coverage."
    },
    {
      title: 'Pressure Regulation Problems',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Springtown properties can experience variable water pressure that damages irrigation components. Too much pressure causes misting and rapid wear of internal valve parts, while insufficient pressure results in inadequate coverage. We install appropriate pressure regulators and zone-specific pressure compensating heads to maintain optimal performance regardless of supply variations."
    },
    {
      title: 'Soil Shifting & Line Breaks',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Springtown's clay soil expands during rainy periods and contracts during drought, putting stress on rigid PVC pipes and fittings. This seasonal movement often causes underground leaks at connection points. Our repair approach uses flexible couplings at strategic junction points that accommodate ground movement without compromising system integrity."
    },
    {
      title: 'Controller Programming Issues',
      icon: 'check',
      content: "Many Springtown systems suffer from improper programming that doesn't account for local watering needs or seasonal adjustments. We recalibrate controllers to optimize watering while respecting water conservation principles, incorporating seasonal adjustments and integrating with weather sensors to prevent watering during rain events."
    },
    {
      title: 'Well System Integration Problems',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Properties using well water often experience unique challenges with pressure tanks, filtration systems, and irrigation integration. We specialize in troubleshooting and repairing these complex systems, ensuring proper filtration, pressure regulation, and component protection from well water contaminants."

  diagnosticProcess: [
    {
      title: 'System Inspection',
      content: "We begin with a comprehensive evaluation of your entire irrigation system, checking each zone for proper operation, inspecting heads for damage or misalignment, and testing valve function to identify both obvious and hidden issues."
    },
    {
      title: 'Pressure Testing',
      content: "Using calibrated gauges, we measure static and dynamic water pressure throughout your system to identify pressure loss points, excessive pressure zones, or flow restrictions that might indicate leaks or blockages."
    },
    {
      title: 'Controller Analysis',
      content: "We examine your controller programming, wiring connections, and sensor integration to ensure everything is functioning correctly and optimized for Springtown's climate conditions and water conservation needs."
    },
    {
      title: 'Repair Implementation',
      content: "Based on our findings, we perform necessary repairs—replacing damaged components, clearing blockages, fixing leaks, and adjusting heads—using high-quality parts specifically selected for durability in local conditions."
    },
    {
      title: 'System Calibration',
      content: "After repairs are complete, we fine-tune each zone, adjusting head spray patterns, optimizing run times, and programming your controller for maximum efficiency while ensuring full coverage of your landscape."

    {
      title: 'Spring System Audit',
      content: "Before the hot season begins, schedule a comprehensive inspection to test each zone, clean filters, check valve operation, and verify controller programming for seasonal appropriateness."
    },
    {
      title: 'Monthly Visual Inspection',
      content: "Regularly observe your system during operation, looking for heads that aren't popping up fully, uneven spray patterns, excessively wet areas (potential leaks), or dry spots that may indicate developing problems."
    },
    {
      title: 'Controller Updates',
      content: "Adjust your watering schedule quarterly to account for seasonal shifts, particularly reducing frequency during winter months and adapting to water conservation needs during summer."
    },
    {
      title: 'Winterization',
      content: "Prepare your system for winter freezes by insulating exposed components and knowing how to drain the system if temperatures drop below freezing for extended periods."
