  introduction: "Keller's upscale properties with extensive landscaping face unique irrigation challenges due to the area's variable terrain, mixed soil composition, and seasonal weather extremes. From the established neighborhoods of Old Town Keller to newer developments in the north, irrigation systems require specialized maintenance to address issues caused by limestone substrates, water quality variations, and temperature fluctuations. When your system shows signs of trouble—through uneven coverage, pressure inconsistencies, or unexpected increases in water consumption—professional repair services can quickly restore optimal function while preserving your landscape investment.",
  
  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Limestone Substrate Damage',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Keller's rocky, limestone-rich soil creates unique challenges for irrigation lines, causing stress fractures and abrasion at contact points. We repair damaged lines using techniques specifically designed for rocky soil conditions and install protective sleeves at vulnerable locations to prevent future issues and extend system lifespan."
    },
    {
      title: 'High-Pressure Component Failure',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Many Keller neighborhoods experience higher-than-standard municipal water pressure that accelerates wear on system components, particularly valves and spray heads. We address these failures with pressure-regulation solutions and install components rated for Keller's specific pressure conditions to prevent recurring damage."
