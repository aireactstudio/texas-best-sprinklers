  introduction: "Hurst's mix of established neighborhoods and redeveloped areas creates unique irrigation repair challenges. From the mature landscapes of Bellaire to newer commercial-adjacent properties, irrigation systems face stress from varying soil conditions, age-related wear, and municipal water characteristics. When your system develops issues—whether through inconsistent coverage, increasing water bills, or visible problems—professional repair services can quickly diagnose and resolve issues with solutions tailored to Hurst's specific conditions.",
  
  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Aging System Deterioration',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Many Hurst properties feature irrigation systems that are 15-25 years old with components reaching the end of their functional lifespan. We specialize in identifying failing parts—from deteriorating pipe to worn valve components—and strategically replacing them with modern, more efficient alternatives that integrate with existing systems."
    },
    {
      title: 'Mixed Development Soil Issues',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Hurst properties frequently feature modified soil profiles from decades of development, creating drainage issues and irregular soil movement patterns. Our repairs address these challenges with flexible coupling technology and specialized installation techniques that accommodate the unique soil conditions found throughout Hurst neighborhoods."

      title: 'Water Quality Effects',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Hurst's municipal water contains minerals that gradually accumulate in spray heads, drip emitters, and valve components, restricting flow and causing uneven distribution. We implement specialized cleaning procedures that dissolve these deposits without damaging components and install appropriate filtration to reduce future buildup."

    {
      title: 'Traffic Vibration Damage',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Properties near Highway 183/121 and major Hurst thoroughfares experience continuous vibration that gradually loosens fittings and creates small leaks in irrigation systems. We implement vibration-resistant repairs including thread sealants and locking components that maintain integrity despite these environmental factors."
    },
    {
      title: 'Outdated Controller Technology',
      icon: 'check',
      content: "Many Hurst systems still operate with basic controllers that lack water-saving features and proper programming flexibility. We upgrade these systems with smart controllers that integrate weather data, offer remote management capabilities, and provide the programming options needed for optimal water conservation in Hurst's variable climate."
