  introduction: "Arlington's diverse landscape—from the established properties near UTA to newer developments in south Arlington—presents unique challenges for irrigation systems. The region's clay-heavy soils, municipal water quality variations, and extreme temperature fluctuations put constant stress on system components. When your sprinklers show signs of trouble through uneven coverage, pressure issues, or unexpected increases in water bills, professional repair services can quickly diagnose problems and implement lasting solutions tailored to Arlington's specific conditions.",
  
  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Clay Soil Pipe Stress',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Arlington's expansive clay soils contract significantly during drought periods and expand during rainy seasons, creating shifting ground that stresses rigid irrigation pipes and connections. Our repairs address these breaks using flexible couplings at key junction points and proper installation techniques that accommodate seasonal ground movement."
    },
    {
      title: 'Spray Head Obstruction',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Many Arlington neighborhoods feature mature landscapes where growing plants gradually obstruct sprinkler heads, causing poor distribution and dry spots. We reposition affected heads, install extension risers where appropriate, and adjust spray patterns to ensure proper coverage as landscapes mature."
    },
    {
      title: 'Municipal Pressure Fluctuations',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Arlington's municipal water system experiences pressure variations, particularly during peak usage hours in summer months. These fluctuations can damage valves and create inconsistent spray patterns. We install pressure regulators and pressure-compensating spray heads to maintain consistent performance regardless of supply pressure."
    },
    {
      title: 'Electrical Control Failures',
      icon: 'check',
      content: "Arlington's summer thunderstorms and power fluctuations frequently damage irrigation controllers and valve solenoids. We diagnose and repair these electrical components, install surge protection, and ensure proper grounding to prevent future storm-related failures."
    },
    {
      title: 'Valve Malfunctions',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "The mineral content in Arlington's water supply gradually deteriorates valve components, causing them to stick open or closed. We rebuild or replace damaged valves with models specifically designed to withstand local water quality issues while maintaining reliable operation."

  diagnosticProcess: [
    {
      title: 'System Evaluation',
      content: "We begin with a comprehensive inspection of your irrigation system, testing each zone for proper operation, checking spray patterns, and identifying visible problems as well as underlying issues that might not be immediately apparent."
    },
    {
      title: 'Pressure & Flow Testing',
      content: "Using calibrated gauges, we measure water pressure and flow rates throughout your system to pinpoint restrictions, leaks, or pressure problems that affect performance and efficiency."
    },
    {
      title: 'Electrical Diagnostics',
      content: "We perform thorough testing of your controller, valve wiring, solenoids, and sensors to identify any electrical issues that might be causing zones to malfunction or fail to operate."
    },
    {
      title: 'Targeted Repairs',
      content: "Based on our findings, we implement necessary repairs using high-quality replacement parts specifically selected for durability in Arlington's soil and water conditions, addressing root causes rather than symptoms."
    },
    {
      title: 'Performance Calibration',
      content: "After completing repairs, we adjust each zone for optimal coverage, fine-tune spray patterns, calibrate pressure settings, and program your controller according to Arlington's watering restrictions and your landscape's specific needs."
