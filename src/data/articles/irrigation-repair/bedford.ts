  introduction: "Bedford's established neighborhoods with mature landscapes present unique irrigation repair challenges. From the older homes in central Bedford to the communities near the airport, local irrigation systems face stress from aging components, evolving landscapes, and the area's clay-heavy soil composition. When your system develops issues—whether through inconsistent coverage, increasing water bills, or visible leaks—professional repair services can quickly diagnose problems and implement lasting solutions tailored to Bedford's specific conditions.",
  
  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Aging System Components',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Many Bedford homes feature irrigation systems that are 15+ years old with components reaching the end of their functional lifespan. We specialize in identifying deteriorating parts—from cracking valve diaphragms to worn nozzles—and replacing them with modern, more efficient alternatives that integrate seamlessly with existing systems."
    },
    {
      title: 'Clay Soil Pipe Damage',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Bedford's predominantly clay soil expands and contracts dramatically with moisture changes, stressing rigid irrigation pipes and connections. Our repair techniques utilize flexible couplings and proper installation methods that accommodate ground movement, preventing recurring leaks during seasonal transitions."

      title: 'Root Intrusion Problems',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Bedford's mature trees and established landscapes create ongoing challenges as growing roots encounter and damage irrigation lines. We implement specialized repairs for root-damaged sections and install protective measures such as root barriers and line rerouting to prevent recurrence while preserving valuable trees."

    {
      title: 'Outdated Controller Technology',
      icon: 'check',
      content: "Many Bedford systems still operate with obsolete controllers that lack water-saving features and proper programming flexibility. We upgrade these systems with modern smart controllers that integrate weather data, offer remote access, and provide the programming capabilities needed for optimal water management in Bedford's variable climate."
    },
    {
      title: 'Coverage Gaps from Landscape Changes',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Over decades, Bedford homeowners have modified landscapes without corresponding irrigation adjustments, creating coverage gaps and inefficient watering patterns. We reconfigure these systems to match current landscape needs, adding or relocating heads to ensure complete coverage without wasteful overspray."
