  introduction: "Sprinkler installation in Keller is vital for preserving the vibrant lawns and garden beds that define this affluent suburb northwest of Fort Worth. Keller's humid subtropical climate brings hot summers, abundant rainfall in spring and fall, and occasional winter freezes—conditions that demand a flexible irrigation solution. Whether you're nurturing turf in the rolling lawns of Heritage Hills or maintaining ornamental plantings around Bear Creek Park, a professionally engineered sprinkler system delivers tailored coverage, conserves water, and protects your landscape investment.",

      title: 'Clay-Loam Soil Compaction',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Keller's native soils often consist of dense clay-loam that compacts over time, leading to uneven infiltration and surface runoff. We begin every project with an infiltration test to gauge percolation rates. Based on the results, we select matched-precipitation spray nozzles and rotary heads spaced to balance coverage with slow application. In compacted areas, our crews perform soil aeration prior to trenching to loosen the ground and enhance root establishment once irrigation begins."

      title: 'Rolling Topography',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Neighborhoods like Keller Pointe and Vista Ridge feature gentle slopes that can concentrate water flow at low points. To prevent erosion and pooling, we divide yards into multiple zones with separate run times, installing pressure-regulating valves and low-angle rotary nozzles on inclines to reduce misting and runoff. Check-valve risers keep each zone from draining when the system shuts off, avoiding soggy patches near sidewalks and driveways."

      title: 'Seasonal Water Restrictions',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "The City of Keller enforces odd/even watering days year-round and prohibits irrigation during the midday heat from 10 AM to 6 PM in summer months. Our smart controllers integrate local weather data and rain sensors to automatically adjust schedules, ensuring compliance while maximizing plant health. For customers who travel frequently, Wi-Fi–enabled controllers allow remote adjustments in real time, accommodating unexpected rain or frost events."
    },
    {
      title: 'Freeze Protection',
      icon: 'check',
      content: "Although winters are mild, brief freezes can damage sprinkler components if left running. We install freeze sensors that suspend irrigation below 35 °F and resume operations once temperatures rise, protecting pipes and heads from cracking. Each system also includes quick-flush filters at zone inlets to prevent debris buildup from heavy spring rains or fall leaf drop."

      title: 'HOA & Permit Coordination',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Many Keller communities, including The Estates at Parker Hill and The Landings, require irrigation permits and adherence to architectural guidelines for visible sprinkler components. We handle all utility locates, permit submissions, and HOA plan reviews on your behalf, ensuring a seamless installation that respects setback rules and preserves neighborhood aesthetics."
