  introduction: "Westlake's combination of sprawling ranchlands and architecturally stunning estates demands an irrigation solution that performs as beautifully as it looks. With summer highs often near 100°F and winter lows occasionally dipping below freezing, a precision-engineered sprinkler system delivers targeted moisture to turf, garden beds, and pasture areas. Westlake's varied terrain—from rocky limestone outcrops to sandy loam slopes—calls for a design that's calibrated to local soils and microclimates.",

    {
      title: 'Rock-Laden Soil Conditions',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Installing piping through Westlake's limestone-substrate requires specialized trenching techniques. We start with geotechnical soil probes to locate hardpan layers, then employ drill-assisted trenching or trenchless header installation to preserve the landscape's natural contours."
    },
    {
      title: 'Drainage Variability',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Sandy loam regions absorb water rapidly, while clay-limestone pockets retain moisture longer. By pairing rotary-stream heads for quick applications with low-angle spray nozzles for slower-soaking zones—and programming multiple short cycles—we optimize infiltration without runoff or dry patches."
    },
    {
      title: 'Large-Scale Pressure Management',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Estate properties often span multiple acres, creating pressure imbalances across distant zones. Our system designs include booster pumps and multi-zone pressure-regulating manifolds, ensuring heads on hilltop lawns perform identically to those in valleys or gardens."
    },
    {
      title: 'Regulatory & Aesthetic Requirements',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Westlake's codes mandate underground backflow preventers and concealed valve assemblies. We prep detailed engineering plans for town approval, install approved vaults, and coordinate inspections—blending code compliance seamlessly into each estate's design."

  process: [
    {
      title: 'Site Evaluation',
      content: "Conduct soil core sampling, topographic surveys, and vegetation assessments to tailor the irrigation blueprint."
    },
    {
      title: 'Design & Zoning',
      content: "Use hydraulic modeling to create distinct zones—turf, gardens, paddocks—with appropriately selected heads and valves."
    },
    {
      title: 'Installation',
      content: "Lay mains and laterals below the frost line, set up pressure-regulated booster stations, and install backflow preventers in discreet vaults."
    },
    {
      title: 'Controller Configuration',
      content: "Program smart controllers with local watering restrictions, integrate weather and freeze sensors, and enable remote-access controls."
    },
    {
      title: 'Testing & Handoff',
      content: "Perform flow and uniformity tests, adjust nozzles and schedules, and provide a full system walkthrough to the homeowner or property manager."
