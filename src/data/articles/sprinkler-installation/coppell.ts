  introduction: "In Coppell, where mature oak canopies and manicured subdivisions coexist, an irrigation system must be as nuanced as the landscapes it serves. Whether you're preserving the verdant lawn of an Old Town heritage property or hydrating new plantings in the Northlake area, professional sprinkler installation provides consistent moisture tailored to Coppell's climate. Local soil conditions—ranging from quick-draining sandy loam near the lake to heavier clay inland—combined with the city's summer heat and occasional winter chill, demand a solution that adapts to every micro-zone.",

      title: 'Protecting Tree Roots & Shade Zones',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Coppell's signature tree-lined streets create shaded areas where traditional sprays can harm shallow roots and encourage fungal growth. We employ trenchless header installation to avoid root disturbance and use low-flow drip emitters under canopy edges. These deliver water directly to root zones without overspray, preserving both tree health and turf vitality."
    },
    {
      title: 'Soil Variability',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Across Coppell, the ground can shift abruptly from sandy fill—where moisture vanishes quickly—to pockets of compacted clay that resist absorption. We perform a detailed infiltration survey to map these transitions, then select a blend of rotary stream heads for sandy areas and matched-precipitation spray nozzles for clay zones. Custom run times for each zone ensure water soaks in fully without pooling or wastage."
    },
    {
      title: 'Watering Regulations',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Coppell enforces odd/even address watering days and prohibits irrigation between 10 AM and 6 PM during the summer months. Our weather-responsive controllers integrate local ET data and on-site rain sensors to automatically adjust or suspend cycles, so homeowners stay compliant without manually resetting timers."
    },
    {
      title: 'HOA Aesthetic Guidelines',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Many Coppell neighborhoods—such as Stratford Park and Coppell Heights—require discreet placement of valves and backflow prevention assemblies. We handle all permit submissions and HOA plan approvals, installing low-profile valve boxes and burying piping to maintain the pristine curb appeal your community demands."
    },
    {
      title: 'Freeze & Debris Management',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Even a single freeze event below 35 °F can damage unprotected risers. Our systems include freeze sensors that pause irrigation during frost warnings and resume when temperatures climb. Inline debris filters safeguard nozzles from sediment and leaf litter uprooted by spring storms, and quick-disconnect spray bodies make maintenance fast and tool-free."
