  introduction: "Sprinkler installation in Arlington is critical for maintaining lush, green landscapes amid the city's humid subtropical climate, where summer highs often reach the upper 90s and occasional winter freezes threaten sprinkler components. Whether you're watering turf around Globe Life Field or irrigating foundation plantings in the Viridian community, a custom-designed system ensures even coverage, water efficiency, and healthy growth. Arlington's native soils—ranging from heavy clay in South Arlington to sandy loams near Lake Arlington—have unique infiltration and retention characteristics, so precise head selection, zoning, and scheduling are key to preventing runoff and overwatering.",

      title: 'Clay Soils & Runoff',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Much of western Arlington features expansive clay soils that hold water but seal off when compacted, causing surface runoff. To address this, we begin with a percolation test to determine infiltration rates. We then specify matched-precipitation spray nozzles (e.g., Rain Bird MPR series) spaced 15–20 feet apart for turf zones, combined with short-cycle scheduling that allows water to soak in before the next round."
    },
    {
      title: 'Sandy Loam Zones Near Lake Arlington',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Properties closer to Lake Arlington often sit on sandy-loam soils that drain quickly, risking drought stress in turf and ornamentals. We integrate deep-root drip lines and micro-spray emitters for planting beds, delivering slow-release moisture to roots without evaporative loss. Turf areas receive rotary stream rotors with lower precipitation rates to encourage deeper root growth."
    },
    {
      title: 'Watering Restrictions & Drought',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "The City of Arlington enforces odd/even watering days year-round and bans irrigation between 10 AM–6 PM from June through September. Our WeatherTRAK and Hunter Pro-HC controllers sync automatically with local weather stations to adjust schedules based on rain, temperature, and evapotranspiration data—ensuring compliance and maximizing efficiency."
    },
    {
      title: 'Freeze & Storm Protection',
      icon: 'check',
      content: "Arlington's winters can briefly dip below freezing. We install freeze sensors that automatically suspend irrigation when temperatures approach 35 °F, protecting pipes and heads. Heavy summer storms can shift heads or clog filters; our systems include debris screens on each zone and quick-connect nozzles for easy cleaning and realignment."

    {
      title: 'Permitting & HOA Compliance',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Most Arlington neighborhoods—Paine Davis, The Parks at Arlington, and others—require irrigation permits and adherence to setback rules. We handle all utility locates, permit submittals, and HOA reviews, ensuring your installation meets City Development Services requirements without delay."

  timeline: "Most residential sprinkler system installations in Arlington are completed within 2-3 days, depending on property size and system complexity. After your initial consultation, we typically schedule installation within 2-3 weeks. The permitting process through Arlington usually takes 5-7 business days, with HOA approvals potentially adding another 3-5 days. Once installed, your system will be fully operational immediately, with a follow-up inspection scheduled 2 weeks after completion to ensure everything is functioning optimally.",
