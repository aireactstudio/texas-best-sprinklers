  introduction: "In Benbrook, where lakeside properties and established neighborhoods create diverse landscaping needs, professional sprinkler installation ensures reliable irrigation tailored to local conditions. From the rolling terrain of lakefront homes to the more level properties in established communities, Benbrook landscapes benefit from irrigation systems designed to address varying soil compositions, elevation changes, and the unique microclimate influenced by Benbrook Lake.",

    {
      title: 'Variable Terrain',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Benbrook's rolling topography, especially near the lake, creates natural drainage patterns that affect water distribution. Our systems incorporate check valves to prevent low-head drainage and utilize pressure-regulating heads that maintain consistent spray patterns regardless of elevation changes. This approach ensures uniform coverage across uneven terrain while preventing wasteful runoff."
    },
    {
      title: 'Mixed Soil Profiles',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Benbrook properties often feature varying soil compositions—from rocky limestone-based soils to clay-heavy areas. We analyze soil infiltration rates across your property and design zones accordingly, using appropriate head types and custom run times to ensure water penetrates effectively in each area. This customized approach prevents both wasteful runoff and insufficient irrigation."

      title: 'Lakeside Wind Considerations',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Properties near Benbrook Lake experience consistent winds that can disrupt spray patterns from standard irrigation heads. For these areas, we install wind-resistant nozzles with heavier water droplets that resist drift. We also position rotors strategically to account for prevailing wind directions, ensuring water reaches intended targets despite breezy conditions."
    },
    {
      title: 'Tree Canopy Management',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Benbrook's mature tree canopies create significant shade patterns that affect water requirements. We map these microclimate zones during design and install separate zones for shaded versus sunny areas. This precision prevents overwatering in shade zones while ensuring adequate moisture in sun-exposed sections, promoting healthier landscapes and conservation."

    {
      title: 'Water Restriction Compliance',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Benbrook implements seasonal water restrictions, particularly during summer months. Our smart controller systems integrate local weather data and automatically adjust to comply with current watering schedules. Rain sensors and soil moisture monitors further optimize operation, suspending irrigation during rainfall and resuming only when landscapes require additional moisture."
