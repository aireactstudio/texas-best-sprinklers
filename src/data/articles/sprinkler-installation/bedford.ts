  introduction: "Sprinkler installation in Bedford delivers precise irrigation for homeowners and businesses navigating this mid-way point between Dallas and Fort Worth. With summer highs regularly breaching 95°F and occasional cold snaps, reliable watering is crucial to preserve turf in neighborhoods like Bedford Commons and foundation plantings around Bedford Boys Ranch Park. Bedford's soil profile—predominantly silty-clay with scattered sandy loam—demands a tailored system that balances moisture retention with efficient drainage.",
  
  challenges: [
    {
      title: 'Compacted Silty-Clay & Runoff',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Bedford's silty-clay soils can form a tight crust under heavy rain or rapid sprays, causing water to pool at low spots. We conduct percolation tests to gauge soil absorption, then install matched-precipitation spray nozzles (such as Rain Bird 1800 series) spaced to prevent surface glazing. Short-cycle scheduling splits run times into multiple intervals, letting water soak in gradually."
    },
    {
      title: 'Sandy Loam Pockets',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Some properties near the Bedford Boys Ranch exhibit sandy soil that drains quickly, risking dry patches. We integrate subsurface drip lines for shrubs and micro-sprays for ornamental beds, delivering slow, deep hydration directly to roots without overspray or evaporation losses."
    },
    {
      title: 'City Watering Ordinances',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Bedford enforces twice-weekly watering and bans irrigation between 10 AM and 6 PM from June through September. Our smart controllers sync with municipal weather feeds and on-site rain sensors to auto-adjust schedules, ensuring compliance and avoiding fines."
    },
    {
      title: 'Freeze & Storm Preparedness',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Though winters are mild, brief freezes can crack exposed risers and heads. Freeze sensors automatically halt irrigation when temperatures dip below 36 °F and resume once conditions improve. In spring and fall, inline debris filters and quick-disconnect nozzles simplify cleanup after wind-driven leaves and grit."
    },
    {
      title: 'HOA & Permit Coordination',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Communities such as Meadowmere and Bedford Springs require irrigation permits and restrict visible hardware. We handle utility locates, submit permit applications to Public Works, and prepare HOA plan packets—so installations align with setback rules and neighborhood aesthetics."

    {
      title: 'Year-Round Beauty',

      title: 'Custom Design',
      content: "Hydraulic calculations and zoning best practices dictate head types—rotors for lawns, sprays for borders, drip for beds."

    {
      title: 'Installation',
      content: "Technicians trench color-coded mains and laterals below the frost line, install high-grade piping, and mount heads with built-in check valves and pressure regulators."
