  introduction: "Installing a sprinkler system in Hurst ensures your lawn stays emerald-green despite scorching summer afternoons and the occasional winter chill. From residential yards in Ridgewood Park to commercial properties along Pipeline Road, precisely calibrated irrigation delivers just the right amount of moisture. Hurst's soils—often a mix of silty clay with sandier patches—require careful nozzle selection and zoning to avoid both pooling and dry spots, making professional design and installation essential for a thriving landscape.",

      title: 'Mixed Soil Textures',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Many Hurst properties straddle silty-clay areas that hold water alongside sandier soil that drains rapidly. We start each project by performing infiltration tests at several points, then deploy a combination of rotary heads for broad turf zones and drip lines for planting beds. Short, repeated watering cycles on clay sections prevent surface sealing, while longer, low-flow drips in sandy areas encourage deep root growth without runoff."

      content: "Hurst enforces odd/even watering days and blocks irrigation from 10 AM to 6 PM in the summer peak. Our smart controllers—compatible with Hunter and Rain Bird systems—sync with local weather feeds and on-site rain sensors to adjust schedules automatically, ensuring compliance and conserving water even when you're away."

      title: 'Pressure Variability',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Homes near Eagle Mountain Lake often contend with fluctuating water pressure. We install precision pressure-regulating valves and pressure-compensating nozzles that maintain uniform spray patterns regardless of supply swings—eliminating dry corners and preventing overspray onto sidewalks."

      title: 'Freeze & Debris Safeguards',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Even brief frost can damage unprotected risers. Our systems include freeze sensors that suspend irrigation below 35 °F and resume once temperatures stabilize. Inline debris screens trap sediment and leaf litter stirred up by spring storms, and quick-release nozzles make cleanup fast and hassle-free."

      title: 'HOA & Permit Coordination',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Communities like Heritage Park and Sun Valley require irrigation permits and strict placement guidelines. We handle all utility locates, submit permit applications to Public Works, and prepare HOA compliance packets—streamlining approval so installation stays on schedule."
