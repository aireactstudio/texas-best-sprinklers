  introduction: "Sprinkler installation in Southlake delivers reliable irrigation for upscale properties across this Dallas–Fort Worth suburb, where summer highs frequently climb into the mid-90s and occasional winter freezes pose risks to outdoor systems. From the grand estates of Timarron to the vibrant landscaping around Southlake Town Square, a custom irrigation network ensures even coverage, maximizes water efficiency, and maintains the pristine curb appeal Southlake homeowners demand.",

      title: 'Calcareous Clay Soils',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Much of Southlake rests on dense calcareous clay that holds moisture but can form surface \"seals\" under heavy rainfall, leading to runoff. We perform soil infiltration tests to determine percolation rates, then specify matched-precipitation nozzles—typically MP Rotators—for turf zones. Short-cycle scheduling breaks run times into multiple passes, allowing water to soak in and reducing puddling."
    },
    {
      title: 'High Water Demand & Restrictions',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Southlake enforces odd/even watering days and prohibits irrigation between 10 AM and 6 PM from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Our Hunter Pro-HC and Rain Bird ESP-Me smart controllers integrate local evapotranspiration data and on-site rain sensors to automatically adjust or suspend cycles—ensuring compliance without manual intervention."
    },
    {
      title: 'Large Lots & Variable Pressure',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Estate properties in neighborhoods like Shady Oaks and Stonegate span half-acre parcels, where peak demand on multiple zones can strain domestic supply. We incorporate booster pumps and pressure-regulating valves to balance flow across distant heads. Pressure-compensating nozzles maintain uniform spray arcs even when lines vary in elevation."
    },
    {
      title: 'Freeze & Storm Protection',
      icon: 'check',
      content: "Although Southlake winters are generally mild, the occasional plunge below 32 °F can damage exposed components. We install freeze sensors that suspend irrigation below 35 °F and resume automatically when temperatures rise. Debris-resistant filters and quick-disconnect nozzles simplify cleanup after summer thunderstorms that blow leaves and sediment into the system."

      title: 'HOA Covenants & Permitting',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Southlake communities uphold strict architectural guidelines governing visible irrigation components and plantings. We handle all city utility locates, irrigation permits, and HOA plan submissions for subdivisions such as The Traditions and Harbor Village, ensuring head locations and backflow assemblies meet setback and aesthetic requirements."

    {
      title: 'Custom Design',
      content: "Head and nozzle selection are tailored for each microzone—rotors for open turf, sprays for narrow corridors, and drip for beds. Hydraulic calculations ensure balanced pressure and consistent coverage throughout your property."
    },
    {
      title: 'Installation',
      content: "Color-coded mainlines and lateral lines are trenched to a minimum depth of 12 inches. Check-valve risers and pressure regulators maintain system integrity and prevent low-point drainage, reducing water waste and preventing landscape damage."

    {
      title: 'Controller Setup',
      content: "Smart controllers are programmed with local watering restrictions and weather adjustments. Wi-Fi connectivity enables remote management, allowing you to monitor and control your irrigation system from anywhere."

  timeline: "Most residential sprinkler system installations in Southlake are completed within 2-3 days, depending on property size and system complexity. After your initial consultation, we typically schedule installation within 2-3 weeks. The permitting process through Southlake usually takes 5-7 business days, with HOA approvals potentially adding another 3-5 days. Once installed, your system will be fully operational immediately, with a follow-up inspection scheduled 2 weeks after completion to ensure everything is functioning optimally.",
