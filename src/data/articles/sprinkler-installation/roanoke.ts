      title: 'Historic Area Considerations',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Roanoke's historic districts feature mature trees and established landscaping that require careful irrigation planning. We utilize minimally invasive installation techniques to preserve heritage plantings and root systems. For properties with historic significance, we implement specialized drip irrigation zones around legacy trees and shrubs while ensuring discreet system visibility that maintains period authenticity."

      title: 'Clay-Dominant Soil Profile',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Roanoke's predominantly clay soil absorbs water slowly but retains moisture longer than sandier compositions. Our systems incorporate matched-precipitation rotary nozzles that deliver water at appropriate rates to prevent runoff. We implement cycle-and-soak programming that allows water to penetrate clay gradually, ensuring deep root development rather than surface pooling."

      title: 'Water Conservation Regulations',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Roanoke enforces specific watering schedules and conservation measures, particularly during summer months. Our smart controllers integrate these regulations with real-time weather data to ensure automatic compliance. Rain sensors and optional soil moisture monitors further optimize operation by suspending irrigation during rainfall and resuming only when landscape conditions require additional moisture."

    {
      title: 'Mixed-Use Development Proximity',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Many Roanoke residential properties border commercial zones, creating unique water pressure considerations and drainage patterns. We conduct thorough pressure testing during design and implement appropriate zone separation and scheduling to ensure consistent performance regardless of community-wide usage patterns. For properties near commercial areas, we incorporate pressure regulation to maintain optimal spray patterns even during peak usage periods."
