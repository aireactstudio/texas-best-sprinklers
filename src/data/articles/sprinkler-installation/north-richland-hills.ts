  introduction: "North Richland Hills residents know that thriving lawns don't happen by chance—especially when summer temperatures soar and winter chills sneak in. Whether you're caring for turf around Iron Horse Park or lush shrubs in the Kenilworth neighborhood, a bespoke sprinkler system delivers targeted hydration exactly where it's needed. In North Richland Hills's predominantly silty-clay soils, excess water can pool on slight inclines while sandy pockets drain too quickly, making a tailored irrigation design essential for a healthy, emerald-green landscape.",

      title: 'Uneven Soil Texture',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Properties here combine clay's moisture-retention with sandy patches that dry out fast. We perform detailed percolation tests to map these zones, then employ a mix of rotary nozzles for broad turf coverage and drip lines for beds—each calibrated to the ground's absorption rate. By programming shorter run cycles in clay-heavy areas and deeper, slower drips in sandy spots, we achieve balanced watering without waste."

      title: 'Municipal Watering Rules',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "The City of North Richland Hills enforces odd/even watering days and bans irrigation between 10 AM and 6 PM during peak summer months. Our smart-control panels tap into local weather feeds and on-site rain sensors to pause or adjust schedules automatically, so you stay compliant and conserve water without lifting a finger."

      title: 'Pressure Fluctuations',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Homes near Birdview Park often experience water-pressure swings due to varying elevation. We counteract this by installing pressure-regulating valves and precision spray heads that maintain consistent spray patterns even when pressure dips or spikes—no more dry corners or overspray puddles."

    {
      title: 'Freeze & Debris Protection',
      icon: 'check',
      content: "Although winters are brief, frost can still harm exposed pipes and heads. Integrated freeze sensors shut the system off below 37 °F and reactivate it once temperatures normalize. Inline debris filters capture sediment stirred up by spring storms, while quick-connect nozzles make post-storm cleanup swift and simple."

      title: 'HOA & Permitting',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Neighborhoods like Glengarry Estates and Jackson Hills require irrigation permits and adherence to architectural guidelines for visible hardware. We manage all utility locates, file permit applications with Municipal Services, and prepare HOA plan packages—streamlining approval so installation can begin on schedule."
