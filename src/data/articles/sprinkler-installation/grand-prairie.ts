  introduction: "In Grand Prairie's diverse landscape—from the sprawling lawns of Arlington Highlands to the lakeside properties near Joe Pool Lake—an expertly designed sprinkler system is the foundation for a healthy, vibrant yard. With humid summers that push temperatures into the high 90s and occasional frost in winter, precise irrigation keeps turf lush without waste. Grand Prairie's soils range from dense clay in older neighborhoods to sandy fill on new developments, making a one-size-fits-all approach ineffective. A custom-engineered system balances water distribution, respects local watering ordinances, and adapts to the city's unique microclimates, ensuring your lawn and plantings thrive year-round.",

      title: 'Soil Variability Across Districts',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Neighborhoods like Woodland Glen feature heavy clay that retains moisture but can become impermeable, while newer subdivisions such as Prairie Pointe sit on sandy fill that drains too quickly. We conduct multi-point percolation tests to chart these differences, then deploy a mix of rotary stream rotors for turf and low-flow drip tubing for garden beds. Sequential watering cycles on clay areas prevent surface sealing, and longer, low-flow drips in sandy zones encourage deep root development."

      title: 'Summer Heat & Evapotranspiration',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Grand Prairie's proximity to both the prairie and several reservoirs leads to high humidity and intense evapotranspiration rates. Our smart control systems integrate ET data from local weather stations, automatically adjusting run times when temperatures soar or after heavy rainfall. This ensures your landscape receives exactly what it needs—no more, no less—even during July's peak heat waves."

    {
      title: 'Watering Restrictions & Compliance',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Under the City's odd/even watering policy and the daytime irrigation ban from 10 AM to 6 PM in summer, manual schedules can result in violations. Our controllers synchronize with municipal guidelines, pausing zones that would otherwise run during prohibited hours. Homeowners can also manage schedules remotely via smartphone when unexpected weather events arise."

    {
      title: 'Freeze Protection & Debris Management',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Although Grand Prairie winters are mild, brief freezes can damage unprotected heads and pipes. Integrated freeze sensors shut down irrigation when temperatures dip below 35 °F and restart automatically once it warms up. Inline debris filters capture sediment washed in by spring storms, and quick-connect nozzles streamline post-storm cleanup, keeping your system running smoothly."

      title: 'Permit Handling & Neighborhood Covenants',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Areas like Lake Ridge and Grand Horizon include strict setback and visible-equipment guidelines in their covenants. We handle all utility locates, file irrigation permit applications with Development Services, and prepare HOA compliance packets—ensuring head and backflow assembly placements adhere to local regulations without delaying installation."
