  introduction: "Sprinkler installation in Mansfield is key to sustaining vibrant lawns and lush gardens in a city where hot, humid summers alternate with unpredictable spring and fall storms. From family homes in Tierra Verde to commercial properties near the Mansfield National Golf Club, a precision-engineered irrigation system ensures every square foot of turf and planting bed receives the ideal amount of moisture. Mansfield's soils—ranging from sandy loam on newer developments to compacted clay in older neighborhoods—require a thoughtful approach to head selection, zoning, and scheduling for optimal water absorption and runoff control.",

      title: 'Variable Soil Profiles',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "In newer areas like Westhaven, sandy loam drains quickly, while pockets of clay in established subdivisions such as Lake Ridge hold water too well. We perform multi-point infiltration tests to map soil zones and then specify a mix of rotary nozzles for broad turf coverage and subsurface drip lines for flower beds. Short, repeated cycles on clay-heavy sections allow water to soak in, while longer, low-flow drips in sandy areas penetrate deeply without waste."

      title: 'Watering Ordinances & Conservation',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Mansfield enforces odd/even address watering days and bans irrigation between 10 AM and 6 PM during summer months. Our smart controllers integrate local weather station data and on-site rain sensors to automatically suspend or adjust run times, ensuring compliance and maximizing efficiency—even when summer thunderstorms bring surprise downpours."

    {
      title: 'Pressure Fluctuations',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Homes near Lake Arlington Parkway may experience pressure swings due to elevation changes. We install pressure-regulating valves and precision spray heads that maintain consistent spray patterns whether the supply pressure rises or falls—eliminating dry spots and overspray puddles in driveways and sidewalks."
    },
    {
      title: 'Freeze & Debris Protection',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Although winters are brief, temperatures can dip below freezing, risking pipe and head damage. Built-in freeze sensors pause irrigation below 37 °F and resume automatically once it warms up. Inline debris filters capture sediment and leaf litter after spring storms, and quick-release nozzles make cleanup simple and fast."
    },
    {
      title: 'HOA & Permit Handling',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Many Mansfield communities—such as Shadow Creek and Country Club Crossing—require irrigation permits and strict placement guidelines for visible hardware. We handle all utility locates, submit applications to City Development Services, and prepare HOA compliance packets, streamlining approval so installation proceeds on schedule."
