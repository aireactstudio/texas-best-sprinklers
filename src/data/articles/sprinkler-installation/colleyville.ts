  introduction: "Sprinkler installation in Colleyville delivers tailored irrigation solutions for this affluent DFW enclave, where humid subtropical summers and occasional winter freezes combine with clay-rich soils to challenge even the hardiest landscapes. From manicured lawns in Colleyville Heights to the rolling green fairways near the Woodhaven Country Club, a properly engineered sprinkler system ensures consistent coverage, conserves water under the City's watering ordinances, and preserves the curb appeal that Colleyville homeowners expect.",

      title: 'Dense Calcareous Clay Soils',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Colleyville's native calcareous clay tends to compact and form surface \"seals,\" impeding infiltration during heavy rainfall or rapid irrigation. We begin each project with an infiltration test to gauge percolation rates, then specify matched-precipitation rotary nozzles spaced according to manufacturer guidelines to balance run time with soak-in. Short-cycle scheduling—breaking each zone into multiple shorter intervals—allows the clay to absorb water gradually, preventing runoff and erosion."

      title: 'Seasonal Water Restrictions',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Per Colleyville's Code of Ordinances, watering is limited to odd/even addresses and prohibited between 10 AM and 6 PM from May through September. Our smart controllers integrate local evapotranspiration and rain-sensor data to automatically adjust schedules, guaranteeing compliance without manual oversight. Homeowners traveling for business or pleasure can also remotely manage irrigation via Wi-Fi–enabled control panels."

    {
      title: 'Rolling Topography & Variable Pressure',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Properties in neighborhoods like Eagle Glen and Canyon Falls often feature gentle slopes that create pressure differentials across long lateral lines. To ensure uniform coverage, we install pressure-regulating valves and pressure-compensating nozzles that maintain consistent spray patterns regardless of elevation changes. Check-valve risers prevent low-point drainage, eliminating puddles that attract mosquitoes and protecting sidewalks from overspray."
    },
    {
      title: 'Freeze & Storm Protection',
      icon: 'check',
      content: "Colleyville's occasional winter freeze demands frost-sensor integration—our systems automatically suspend irrigation below 35 °F and resume when temperatures rise—to safeguard pipes and heads. In spring and fall, when seasonal storms can introduce debris, we include inline debris screens and quick-disconnect nozzles for easy filter cleaning and head realignment after high winds."

      title: 'HOA Covenants & Permitting',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Many Colleyville subdivisions, such as Parkside and Glenwood Estates, enforce strict amenity and setback guidelines. We handle all utility locates, irrigation permit applications through Public Works, and HOA plan reviews, ensuring head locations and backflow devices meet local rules without delaying project timelines."
