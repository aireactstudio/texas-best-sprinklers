  introduction: "Sprinkler installation in Haltom City brings precision irrigation to a community where scorching summers and occasional freezes test even the hardiest turf. Whether you're tending lawns in Northcrest Estates or foundation plantings around Haltom Oaks, a custom-designed system ensures each zone receives just the right amount of water. With Haltom City's blend of sandy–silt soils and clay pockets, strategic head selection, zoning, and scheduling are key to preventing both runoff and drought stress.",

      title: 'Inconsistent Soil Textures',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Haltom City properties often transition abruptly from fast-draining sandy–silt to dense clay. We begin with multi-point infiltration testing to chart these variations, then deploy rotary-stream heads in sandy sections and matched-precipitation sprays in clay zones. Short, repeated cycle programming lets water absorb gradually, eliminating surface puddles."
    },
    {
      title: 'Storm Debris & Clogging',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Summer thunderstorms can wash sediment into the system, clogging nozzles and reducing performance. Our irrigation setups include robust inline filters on each zone and quick-release spray bodies for tool-free cleaning—so heads stay clear and deliver full coverage."
    },
    {
      title: 'Watering Ordinances',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Under Haltom City's odd/even address schedule and the ban on irrigation from 10 AM–6 PM during summer months, manual timers can lead to penalties. We install weather-sensing controllers that automatically adjust or suspend watering based on local rules, rain events, and freeze warnings."
    },
    {
      title: 'Freeze Protection',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Although freezes are infrequent, even a single night below 35 °F can crack unprotected risers and heads. Integrated freeze sensors halt irrigation when temperatures drop, then resume service once it's safe—safeguarding your investment without manual intervention."
    },
    {
      title: 'HOA & Permitting',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Subdivision covenants in areas like Queens Ridge and Holiday Hills mandate permits and specific equipment placement. We manage utility locates, secure city approvals, and prepare HOA compliance packages—streamlining the process so installation proceeds without delay."

      title: 'Enhanced Curb Appeal',

    {
      title: 'Water Conservation',

      content: "Create multiple zones—rotors for open turf, sprays for borders, drip for beds—with hydraulic calculations ensuring balanced flow."
    },
    {
      title: 'Professional Installation',
      content: "Trench color-coded mains and laterals below the frost line; install check-valve risers, pressure regulators, and robust filters."

      title: 'Controller Setup',
      content: "Program smart panels with Haltom City's watering rules, integrate rain and freeze sensors, and enable remote access if desired."
