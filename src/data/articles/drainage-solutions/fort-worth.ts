  introduction: "Fort Worth properties face unique drainage challenges due to the area's diverse topography, clay-heavy soils, and seasonal rain patterns. From the sloped terrain of neighborhoods like Ridglea and Tanglewood to the lower-lying areas near the Trinity River, water management issues vary significantly across the city. When left unaddressed, poor drainage can lead to foundation damage, landscape erosion, mosquito proliferation, and reduced property value. Texas Best Sprinklers provides custom-engineered drainage solutions designed specifically for Fort Worth's distinct environmental conditions.",
  
  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Expansive Clay Soil Challenges',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Fort Worth's predominantly clay soil expands when wet and contracts when dry, creating significant ground movement that affects water flow patterns and can damage foundations. This soil type prevents proper water absorption and creates surface pooling that requires specialized drainage approaches tailored to Fort Worth's unique soil composition."
    },
    {
      title: 'Topographical Variations',
      icon: 'sun',
      content: "Many Fort Worth neighborhoods feature significant elevation changes that concentrate water runoff in lower areas. Properties in neighborhoods like Ridglea Hills, Berkeley Place, and Rivercrest often experience concentrated water flow patterns that require strategic drainage planning to prevent erosion and property damage."
    },
    {
      title: 'Flash Flood Vulnerability',
      icon: 'droplet',
      content: "Fort Worth's intense storms and rapid rainfall events create flash flooding risks, particularly in areas near the Trinity River and its tributaries. These events overwhelm standard drainage capacity and require robust solutions that can manage large water volumes quickly while protecting valuable property and landscapes."
    },
    {
      title: 'Builder-Grade Inadequacies',
      icon: 'home',
      content: "Many newer Fort Worth developments feature basic builder-grade drainage systems that prove inadequate for the area's specific challenges. These minimum-standard systems fail to account for local soil conditions, property-specific water flow patterns, and Fort Worth's intense seasonal rain events."
    },
    {
      title: 'Historical Property Limitations',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Fort Worth's historic districts like Fairmount, Ryan Place, and Mistletoe Heights often present unique drainage challenges due to their original construction approaches, altered landscapes, and proximity to older municipal systems. These properties require specialized solutions that preserve historical integrity while providing modern water management."
