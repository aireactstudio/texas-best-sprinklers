  introduction: "Hurst properties face distinct drainage challenges shaped by the city's varied topography, clay soil composition, and mature neighborhood development. From established areas like Brookside and College Heights to neighborhoods near Northeast Mall, water management issues vary significantly across the city. When drainage problems remain unaddressed, the consequences include foundation damage, landscape deterioration, mosquito proliferation, and reduced property value. Texas Best Sprinklers provides custom-engineered drainage solutions designed specifically for Hurst's environmental conditions and municipal requirements.",
