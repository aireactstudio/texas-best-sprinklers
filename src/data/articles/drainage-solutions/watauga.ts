  introduction: "Watauga properties face distinctive drainage challenges shaped by the city's established residential character, varied topography, and clay-dominant soil composition. From mature neighborhoods like Watauga Hills to areas such as Whitehurst and Park Vista, water management issues vary across the city. When drainage problems remain unaddressed, the consequences include foundation damage, landscape deterioration, persistent standing water, and reduced property value. Texas Best Sprinklers provides custom-engineered drainage solutions designed specifically for Watauga's environmental conditions and municipal requirements.",
