  introduction: "Arlington properties face distinctive drainage challenges shaped by the city's diverse topography, expansive clay soils, and intense seasonal rainfall patterns. From established neighborhoods in north Arlington to newer developments in the south, water management issues vary significantly across the city. When drainage problems go unaddressed, the consequences include foundation damage, landscape deterioration, mosquito breeding grounds, and diminished property value. Texas Best Sprinklers delivers custom-engineered drainage solutions specifically designed for Arlington's unique environmental conditions and municipal requirements.",

    {
      title: 'Expansive Clay Soil Movement',
      icon: 'map',
      content: "Arlington's clay-dominant soil expands dramatically when wet and contracts during dry periods, creating shifting ground that alters drainage patterns and damages foundations. This soil type often prevents proper absorption, leading to surface water accumulation that requires specialized drainage approaches tailored to Arlington's soil profile."
    },
    {
      title: 'Flash Flooding Vulnerability',
      icon: 'droplet',
      content: "Properties throughout Arlington, particularly those near Rush Creek, Johnson Creek, and Village Creek watersheds, face significant risks during intense rainfall events that overwhelm standard drainage capacity. These areas require robust solutions capable of managing large volumes of water quickly while protecting structures and landscapes."

      title: 'Sports Complex Proximity Effects',
      icon: 'flag',
      content: "Neighborhoods surrounding Arlington's major venues like AT&T Stadium and Globe Life Field often experience altered drainage patterns due to large impervious surfaces and modified water management systems. These properties face unique challenges requiring specialized approaches that account for these large-scale infrastructure impacts."
    },
    {
      title: 'Builder-Grade System Failures',
      icon: 'home',
      content: "Many newer Arlington developments feature basic builder-grade drainage systems that prove inadequate for the area's specific challenges. These minimum-standard installations frequently fail to account for local soil conditions, water flow patterns specific to individual properties, and Arlington's intense seasonal storms."
    },
    {
      title: 'Multi-Property Watershed Issues',
      icon: 'clipboard',
      content: "Arlington's rolling topography creates numerous situations where water flows across multiple properties before reaching municipal systems.
