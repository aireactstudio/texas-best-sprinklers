  introduction: "Arlington's unique blend of urban and suburban landscapes, combined with its variable soil conditions and hot summers, creates specific challenges for sprinkler systems. From the compact clay soils near Lake Arlington to the rockier compositions in western neighborhoods, irrigation systems require specialized knowledge for effective repairs. When your Arlington property shows signs of sprinkler problems—such as dry patches, excessive water bills, or visible leaks—professional diagnosis and repair can quickly restore proper function while conserving water and protecting your landscape investment.",
  
  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Impact Damage to Sprinkler Components',
      icon: 'hammer',
      content: "Arlington's active lifestyle and busy neighborhoods often lead to physical damage to exposed sprinkler heads from lawn equipment, vehicles, and foot traffic. Particularly in areas near AT&T Stadium and the entertainment district, where parking on lawns is common during events, sprinkler systems suffer frequent impact damage. Our technicians expertly replace damaged components with more durable alternatives specifically selected for high-traffic Arlington properties."
    },
    {
      title: 'Soil Movement and Pipe Stress',
      icon: 'mountain',
      content: "Arlington's predominantly clay soils expand significantly during rainy periods and contract during drought, creating shifting pressure on rigid irrigation pipes. This movement is particularly pronounced in neighborhoods like Dalworthington Gardens and Pantego where soil composition varies. Our repair techniques include installing flexible couplings and expansion joints that accommodate soil movement, preventing future leaks and pipe breaks."
    },
    {
      title: 'Mineral Buildup and Clogging',
      icon: 'filter',
      content: "Many Arlington neighborhoods, especially older areas like Central and East Arlington, receive water with high mineral content that gradually deposits inside sprinkler heads and valves. These mineral deposits restrict water flow and distort spray patterns. Our cleaning and maintenance procedures use specialized solutions to dissolve deposits without damaging components, restoring proper operation and extending system life."
    },
    {
      title: 'Electrical and Controller Failures',
      icon: 'bolt',
      content: "Arlington's summer thunderstorms and power fluctuations frequently damage irrigation controllers and electrical components. Systems in neighborhoods like North Arlington and along the Highway 360 corridor are particularly vulnerable to lightning-induced power surges. We diagnose and repair electrical problems, installing surge protection and grounding improvements to prevent future controller damage."
    },
    {
      title: 'Pressure Variation Issues',
      icon: 'tachometer-alt',
      content: "Different Arlington neighborhoods experience varying water pressure levels, with South Arlington typically having higher pressure than northern areas. Excessive pressure causes misting, premature component wear, and water waste, while insufficient pressure creates coverage gaps. We install appropriate pressure regulators and zone-specific pressure-compensating heads to maintain optimal performance regardless of your neighborhood's pressure characteristics."

  diagnosticProcess: [
    {
      title: 'Initial System Assessment',
      content: "We begin with a comprehensive evaluation of your entire irrigation system, activating each zone to observe operation, coverage patterns, and obvious problems. This initial assessment helps us identify visible issues and creates a foundation for more detailed diagnostics."
    },
    {
      title: 'Pressure and Flow Analysis',
      content: "Using calibrated pressure gauges, we measure static and dynamic water pressure throughout your system, identifying pressure losses that might indicate leaks or restrictions. This analysis is particularly important in Arlington neighborhoods with known pressure inconsistencies."
    },
    {
      title: 'Electrical System Testing',
      content: "We perform complete electrical diagnostics on your controller, valve solenoids, and wiring using advanced multimeters and wire tracers. This helps identify controller malfunctions, solenoid failures, or breaks in underground wiring without extensive digging."
    },
    {
      title: 'Precise Leak Detection',
      content: "For suspected underground leaks, we utilize professional sonic leak detection equipment that can pinpoint leak locations within inches. This minimizes necessary excavation and landscape disruption, particularly important for Arlington's established properties with mature landscaping."
