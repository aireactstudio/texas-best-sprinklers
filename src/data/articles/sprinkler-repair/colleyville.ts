      title: 'Root Intrusion and Pipe Damage',
      icon: 'tree',
      content: "Colleyville's abundant mature trees, particularly in established neighborhoods along Glade Road and Pleasant Run, create significant challenges with root intrusion into irrigation lines. The area's post oak and cedar elm trees have aggressive root systems that can crush or penetrate PVC pipes. Our technicians use specialized equipment to clear blockages and implement root barriers to protect repaired lines from future damage, while taking care to preserve Colleyville's valued tree canopy."
