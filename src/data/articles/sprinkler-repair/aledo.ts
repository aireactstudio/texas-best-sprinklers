  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Variable Water Supply Challenges',
      icon: 'faucet',
      content: "Many Aledo properties, particularly in newer developments like Parks of Aledo and Morningstar, experience fluctuating municipal water pressure that can damage irrigation components and affect performance. Other areas rely on well water with unique mineral content and supply characteristics. Our technicians install appropriate pressure regulation devices and filtration systems specifically calibrated to each Aledo water source."
    },
    {
      title: 'Rocky Soil Composition Damage',
      icon: 'mountain',
      content: "Aledo's soil often contains limestone and rock, especially in neighborhoods near FM 1187 and throughout western sections. This rocky composition can damage irrigation pipes through abrasion and shifting, particularly during seasonal temperature changes. We implement specialized repair techniques using pipe sleeves and careful bedding methods that protect against future damage from soil friction."
