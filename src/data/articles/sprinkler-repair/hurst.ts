    {
      title: 'Established System Deterioration',
      icon: 'hourglass-half',
      content: "Many Hurst neighborhoods, particularly in areas like Bellaire and Redbud, feature irrigation systems that are 15-30 years old with components well beyond their expected lifespan. These aging systems often experience multiple simultaneous issues including pipe corrosion, fitting deterioration, and wiring breakdown. Our technicians specialize in strategic repairs that extend system life while improving performance and efficiency."

      title: 'Clay Soil Movement and Pipe Stress',
      icon: 'mountain',
      content: "Hurst's predominantly clay-based soil expands significantly during wet periods and contracts during drought, placing substantial stress on rigid irrigation pipes and connections. This soil movement is particularly problematic in neighborhoods with greater elevation changes like those near Hurst Hills. We implement specialized repair techniques using flexible PVC connections that accommodate this movement while maintaining system integrity."

    {
      title: 'Variable Pressure Conditions',
      icon: 'tachometer-alt',
      content: "Different areas of Hurst experience varying water pressure levels based on elevation and proximity to municipal supply infrastructure. Excessive pressure common in neighborhoods near Bedford-Euless Road can damage sprinkler components and cause misting, while insufficient pressure in elevated areas creates coverage gaps. We install appropriate pressure regulation devices and matched precipitation rate heads to ensure consistent coverage regardless of local conditions."
