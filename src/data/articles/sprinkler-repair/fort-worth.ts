  introduction: "Fort Worth's varied climate and soil conditions create unique challenges for sprinkler systems, often leading to the need for specialized repairs. From the expansive clay soils that shift seasonally to the extreme temperature fluctuations between summer and winter, local irrigation systems face constant stress. When your sprinkler system shows signs of trouble—leaking heads, uneven coverage, or unexplained increases in water bills—professional repair services can quickly diagnose and resolve issues, ensuring your landscape remains beautiful while preventing water waste.",
  
  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Broken or Clogged Sprinkler Heads',
      icon: 'wrench',
      content: "In Fort Worth's high-traffic areas, sprinkler heads are frequently damaged by lawn equipment, foot traffic, or vehicles. Additionally, the city's mineral-rich water can cause calcium buildup in nozzles over time. Our technicians carefully inspect, clean, and replace damaged heads with appropriate models designed for your specific landscape zones and Fort Worth's water quality."

      title: 'Underground Pipe Leaks',
      icon: 'tint',
      content: "Fort Worth's expansive clay soils expand during rainy seasons and contract during drought periods, creating stress on rigid PVC pipes. This seasonal movement often causes fractures or separation at connection points. We use specialized leak detection equipment to pinpoint underground leaks without extensive digging, then implement durable repairs using materials that can withstand Fort Worth's soil movement."

      title: 'Valve and Solenoid Failures',
      icon: 'cog',
      content: "Many neighborhoods in Fort Worth, particularly in older areas like Arlington Heights or Ridglea, experience valve issues due to aging systems and mineral buildup. When valves fail to open or close properly, the result can be either dry patches or water waste. Our repair team specializes in diagnosing electrical and mechanical valve problems, replacing worn components with commercial-grade parts suited to Fort Worth's water chemistry."
