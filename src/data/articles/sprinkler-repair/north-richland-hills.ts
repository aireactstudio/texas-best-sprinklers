      title: 'Pressure Fluctuation Problems',
      icon: 'tachometer-alt',
      content: "Many North Richland Hills neighborhoods, particularly newer developments in the north and east areas, experience significant municipal water pressure variations that can damage sprinkler components and cause coverage problems. Our technicians install appropriate pressure regulation devices and pressure-compensating heads to ensure consistent coverage regardless of your neighborhood's specific pressure characteristics."
