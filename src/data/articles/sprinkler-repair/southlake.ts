      title: 'High-Pressure Damage',
      icon: 'exclamation-circle',
      content: "Many Southlake neighborhoods, particularly those in elevated areas near Highway 114 and along Southlake Boulevard, experience municipal water pressure exceeding optimal levels for irrigation systems. This excessive pressure can damage sprinkler components and cause misting that wastes water. Our technicians install professional-grade pressure regulation devices calibrated to Southlake's specific conditions, protecting system components while ensuring proper coverage."
