  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Lake Effect Soil Movement',
      icon: 'water',
      content: "Properties near Benbrook Lake and throughout the Whitestone area experience significant seasonal soil movement due to fluctuating water tables and moisture levels. This movement places stress on rigid irrigation pipes and connections, causing underground leaks. Our repair techniques incorporate flexible connections and expansion loops that accommodate this movement while maintaining system integrity."
    },
    {
      title: 'Variable Pressure Zones',
      icon: 'tachometer-alt',
      content: "Benbrook's varied elevation creates significant pressure differences between neighborhoods, with areas near Benbrook Boulevard typically experiencing higher pressure than elevated locations like Ridglea Country Club Estates. These variations affect sprinkler performance and component longevity. We install appropriate pressure regulation devices calibrated to your specific location to ensure optimal coverage without damaging components."
    },
    {
      title: 'Mixed Development Age Issues',
      icon: 'building',
      content: "Benbrook features neighborhoods ranging from 1950s constructions along Benbrook Boulevard to new developments near I-20, resulting in irrigation systems of vastly different ages and technologies. Our technicians specialize in repairs for both legacy systems found in established areas and modern installations in newer communities, providing appropriate solutions for each property."
    },
    {
      title: 'Rocky Clay Soil Damage',
      icon: 'mountain',
      content: "Many Benbrook neighborhoods feature clay soil with significant limestone content, particularly in western areas near the lake. This soil composition causes differential settling and expansion that stresses irrigation pipes and causes abrasive damage. We implement specialized repair techniques using protective sleeves and careful bedding methods that prevent future damage from soil movement and rocks."

    {
      title: 'Tree Root Intrusion',
      icon: 'tree',
      content: "Benbrook's mature tree canopy, especially in established neighborhoods like Benbrook Hills and along Mercedes Street, creates challenges with root intrusion into irrigation lines. The area's post oaks and elms have aggressive root systems that can crush or penetrate PVC pipes. We utilize specialized equipment to clear blockages and implement protective measures to prevent future intrusion."
