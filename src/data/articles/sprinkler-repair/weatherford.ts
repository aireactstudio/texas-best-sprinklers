  introduction: "Weatherford's unique landscape characteristics—from its limestone-rich western areas to the more clay-dominant eastern neighborhoods—create distinct challenges for sprinkler system maintenance and repair. The town's rolling terrain, varied soil composition, and sometimes unpredictable water supply conditions require specialized knowledge for effective irrigation system repairs. When Weatherford residents experience sprinkler problems such as coverage issues, increasing water bills, or system failures, professional repair services tailored to local conditions can quickly restore optimal function while protecting valuable landscapes.",
  
  commonIssues: [
    {
      title: 'Rural Water Supply Challenges',
      icon: 'faucet',
      content: "Many Weatherford properties, particularly those in outlying areas like Brock and Peaster Road neighborhoods, rely on well water or rural water supply systems that can experience significant pressure fluctuations. These variations stress sprinkler components and affect coverage. Our technicians install appropriate booster pumps, pressure tanks, and regulation devices specifically calibrated to these Weatherford water supply conditions."
    },
    {
      title: 'Rocky Limestone Soil Damage',
      icon: 'mountain',
      content: "Western Weatherford properties often feature limestone-rich soil with minimal topsoil depth, creating installation challenges and increased potential for pipe damage from sharp rocks. These conditions are particularly common in neighborhoods west of Downtown and near Lake Weatherford. We implement specialized repair techniques using pipe protection sleeves and careful trenching methods that prevent future damage from soil friction."
    },
    {
      title: 'Extreme Temperature Fluctuations',
      icon: 'temperature-high',
      content: "Weatherford experiences more dramatic temperature swings than eastern Metroplex areas, with hotter summers and colder winters. These temperature extremes stress PVC pipes and connections through expansion and contraction cycles. Our repairs utilize components and techniques specifically selected for durability in Weatherford's climate conditions, including deeper pipe burial and expansion fittings at key junctions."
    },
    {
      title: 'Well Water Mineral Content',
      icon: 'filter',
      content: "Many Weatherford irrigation systems run on well water with high mineral content, particularly iron and calcium, that gradually accumulates in sprinkler components. This is especially common in rural properties and those near the Brazos River basin. Our repair procedures include thorough cleaning of affected components and installation of appropriate filtration systems to prevent future mineral buildup."
    },
    {
      title: 'Aging Rural System Infrastructure',
      icon: 'history',
      content: "Weatherford's mix of newer developments and historic properties means irrigation systems vary greatly in age and technology. Older systems, particularly in established neighborhoods like Crestview and areas near Downtown, often require strategic updating of critical components. Our technicians specialize in blending modern technology with existing infrastructure to extend system life without complete replacement."
