      title: 'Diverse Soil Composition Damage',
      icon: 'layer-group',
      content: "Grand Prairie's soil varies significantly across neighborhoods, from clay-dominant areas near Highway 360 to sandier compositions in southern sections near Joe Pool Lake. This soil diversity causes differential settling and movement that stresses irrigation pipes and connections. We implement specialized repair techniques using flexible couplings at strategic junction points to accommodate this soil movement while maintaining system integrity."
